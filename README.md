# Logic Circuits Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of digital circuits using both **combinational** and **sequential logic**. The objective is to build and simulate various logic circuits, utilizing fundamental logic gates and sequential components to demonstrate different logical operations and behaviors.

The project was developed using **Logic Circuit**, a software tool for designing and simulating digital circuits. You can download Logic Circuit from [logiccircuit.org](https://www.logiccircuit.org/).

## Project Details

- **Combinational Logic**: Circuits were designed to perform basic logical functions using combinational logic, including AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates. These circuits generate outputs based solely on the current inputs.
  
- **Sequential Logic**: Sequential circuits were designed to incorporate memory elements, allowing outputs to depend on both current inputs and previous states. Components such as flip-flops and counters were used to demonstrate behaviors like counting sequences and state-based logic.

## Software Used

- **Logic Circuit**: The primary software tool used for circuit design and simulation. Logic Circuit provides a user-friendly interface for creating and testing digital circuits. Download it here: [Logic Circuit](https://www.logiccircuit.org/).

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download and Install Logic Circuit**
